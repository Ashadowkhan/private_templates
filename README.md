# private_templates

 All templates are edited from the original and some are fully edited
 
 These templates include various bypasses I encountered during my bb hunting. 
 
 
**Respect to the original authors !! 
 
 I only edited them to include forbidden bypasses and other few tweaks !!
 
 
 How to use :
 
 save the templates to a folder : for eg folder names: private-templates
 
 nuclei -l listfdomains.txt -t ~/path/to/private-templates | tee -a  nucleid_with_private_templates.txt
