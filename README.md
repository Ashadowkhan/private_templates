Private Nuclei Templates
 All templates are edited from the original . These templates include various bypasses I encountered during my bb hunting. 
 Respect to the original authors ! 
 I only edited them to include forbidden bypasses and other few tweaks !!
 
 
 How to use :
 
 save the templates to a folder : for eg folder names: private-templates
 
 nuclei -l listfdomains.txt --nuclei-templates ~/path/to/private-templates | tee -a  nucleid_with_private_templates.txt
