# private_templates

 All templates are edited from the original and some are fully edited with newly found paths and bypasses. 
 
 
# Respect to the original authors !
 
 I only edited them as a base  to include forbidden bypasses and other few tweaks !!
 
 
 # How to use :
 
 save the templates to a folder : for eg --> folder name: private-templates
 
 nuclei -l listfdomains.txt -t ~/path/to/private-templates | tee -a  nucleid_with_private_templates.txt
